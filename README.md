# DIP_Mosaic
This is a small project for Aesthetic course  

What you need:  

A main image of large size, ex. 1920 * 1440 * 3  
Dataset: Labeled Faces in the Wild Home from http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/  

What I did:  

The result used the faces from different people to present a mosaic effect  
I did not use any algorithms to optimize the performance  
Code runs fast--several minutes is enough  

Demo:

In demo, the main image was of 2048 * 3072 * 3  
The faces were originally of 250 * 250 * 3, while resized to 30 * 30 * 3, which you can decide yourself  
There are several images of different zoom effect to show the picture
